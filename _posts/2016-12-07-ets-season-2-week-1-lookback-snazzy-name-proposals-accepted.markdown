Welcome to the first installment of ETS Lookback (Catchy name suggestions accepted). The plan is that for each weekly ETS swiss tournament, I'll be providing a quick metagame snapshot as well as some comments on the top decks. The question going into this week was: Will Stonescar Burn reproduce it's dominance from the ladder or will it fade as decks go to Bo3 like it did in the invitational last week. To start, let's take a look at the metagame as a whole:

| Deck               | #  | %       |
|:--------------------|:----|:---------|
| Stonescar Burn     | 6  | 16.22%  |
| Other              | 6  | 16.22%  |
| Stonescar Midrange | 5  | 13.51%  |
| Icaria Blue        | 4  | 10.81%  |
| Combrei/X Midrange | 3  | 8.11%   |
| Felnscar           | 3  | 8.11%   |
| Shimmerpack        | 3  | 8.11%   |
| Rakano Warcry      | 3  | 8.11%   |
| Combrei Aggro      | 2  | 5.41%   |
| Haunting Scream    | 2  | 5.41%   |
| Grand Total        | 37 | 100.00% |

As we can see, Stonescar Burn, as well as Midrange, showed up in force, comprising a combined nearly 30% of the overall meta. The next most popular deck, Icaria Blue, was less than half as popular as a Stonescar variant. In the past, we've seen decks show up in large numbers only to fall flat once swiss play started. Let's take a look at the 4-2 or better decks to see how Stonescar Burn did. 

| Player     | Deck              | Record |
|:------------|:-------------------|:--------|
| DDevitt    | Stonescar Burn    | 6-0    |
| jaypeg     | Stonescar Burn    | 5-1    |
| camat0     | Combrei Midrange  | 5-1    |
| zevz2990   | Combrei Midrange  | 4-2    |
| webbwalker | Stonescar Burn    | 4-2    |
| rewind     | Felnscar Midrange | 4-2    |
| Rourke     | Haunting Scream   | 4-2    |
| Ilyak1986  | Elysian Midrange  | 4-2    |
| brlmski    | Combrei Aggro     | 4-2    |
| Crispah    | Combrano Midrange | 4-2    |
| LocoPojo   | Rakano Warcry     | 4-2    |
| MillerTool | Rakano Warcry     | 4-2    |

As we can see, Stonescar Burn posted an impressive day with 3 players finishing with a top record. Overall, Stonescar Burn decks posted a 21-10 record or a 68% win rate. Stonescar Midrange on the other hand, not only had a 9-17 record, none of its pilots finished with a winning record. Impressively, we can see that Combrei and Rakano a relatively large number of decks on top compared to how much was brought to the tournament. 


#Top 8
Let's take a quick look at the top 8 before diving into individual decklists

| Player     | Deck              | Place  |
|:------------|:-------------------|:--------|
| DDevitt    | Stonescar Burn    | 1      |
| jaypeg     | Stonescar Burn    | 2      |
| camat0     | Combrei Midrange  | 3-4    |
| zevz2990   | Combrei Midrange  | 3-4    |
| webbwalker | Stonescar Burn    | 5-8    |
| rewind     | Felnscar Midrange | 5-8    |
| Rourke     | Haunting Scream   | 5-8    |
| Ilyak1986  | Elysian Midrange  | 5-8    |

Unfortunately, both copies of Rakano Warcry managed to miss the top 8 on tiebreakers. Amusingly, the top 8 broke down similarly to how the swiss needed, with the two highest swiss records meeting in the finals. While they dodged each other in the swiss, the winner take all clash in the top 8 along with the invitational invite was taken down DDevitt. 

Let's take a closer look at what each player brought

# Stonescar Burn

As expected, Stonescar Burn was highly successful across the top tables of the tournament. However, each of the three players brought their own take on the achetype. In the end, the version farthest away from stock was the most successful, perhaps exploiting the difference between ladder and Bo3 play.

## [DDevitt](http://www.eternaldecks.cards/deck/QcKQoQtzYk66UyQccomcs)


When first scrolling through this list, it looks like your standard aggressive Stonescar Burn list. At a closer glance however, we can see that DDevitt opted to shave on the high end, going down to 2 Obliterates when 4 is normally standard, along with only playing 1 drake. Additionally, they've also cut the number of Impending Dooms down to 2. In their place, DDevitt opted play 2 Treachery with upping the removal count with more Suffocates, an Annihilate, and a Piercing Shot. This innovation is interesting since it seems like it would help with many of the tempo issues that Stonescar Burn can come across sometimes. However, DDevitt chose to also go down to 2 Argenport Instigators, a card long believed to be absolutely core to the deck's strategy.  The sideboard is packing a large amount of attachment hate, most likely for Xenan Obelisk from Shimmerpack decks, and additional removal as well as some void hate. There's also spicy one of Azindel's Gift that's great in control matchups, though without any card selection or advantage, I'm not sure how often it's actually drawn when needed. There's also a one of Infernal Tyrant which I expect was no small piece of DDevitt's sideboard plan in the mirror. 

## [jaypeg](http://www.eternaldecks.cards/deck/3Vp4Z4cG0ME48mS8qmi0eM)

jaypeg on the other hand, brought pretty much a stock "Big Burn" list. While this does leave me devoid of too much to talk about, his sideboard choices are interesting compared to DDevitt's. Like DDevitt, he has 4 pieces of attachement removal, 2 pieces of void hate, and an Azindel's Gift which may very well be standard as part of all Shadow sideboards from now on. Unlike DDevitt who opted for 3 copies of the fast spell Ruin which can sometimes lead to blowouts against Xenan Obelisk decks, jaypeg opted for straight 4 Furnace Mage which provides a respectable body. jaypeg also chose to pack the full 4 Plagues, insisting on being ready for any Vault token shenanigans. jaypeg's spicy one of is a copy of Vara, Fate-Touched. Vara is another great tool in games that go long, with reanimiating an Umbrean Reaper often being just too much for the opponent to handle. 

## [webbwalker](http://www.eternaldecks.cards/deck/5k3i9nPVu0eIOQu228wG64)

webbwalker chose to go in the opposite direction of jaypeg in his choice and chose a close to stock "Aggro Burn" list. Again, there's not much to say about the main deck as it's largely a known quantity, but webbwalker's sideboard plan shows an interesting strategy. While everyone has been consistant in playing 4 pieces of attachment hate, instead of playing an Azindel's Gift, webbwalker has decided that either finding the Gift is too low odds, or the control matchups are just good enough. The big difference between webbwalker's board and the other two Stonescar Burn lists is the 3 copies of Sabotage. Sabotage is a card that can be highly effective in both the mirror and other matchups, taking removal, burn, or even weapons or Xenan Obelisks from your opponent. webbwalker also must hate Dawnwalker since they chose to play the full 4 void hate pieces. 

After examining the specter over the format that is Stonescar Burn, let's examine some of the other top decks and perhaps how they chose to fight against our fiery overlords. 

# Combrei Midrange

Long thought to be dead in open beta with both the nerf to Secret Pages and the ascension of Stonescar Burn, Combrei Midrange showed that reports of its demise was greatly exaggerated. However, across the swiss and top 8, the deck posted a pitiful 2-4 record against Stonescar Burn, perhaps highlighting a key weakness in a field of burn decks. 

## [camat0](https://www.eternaldecks.cards/deck/6Usc7s64femeyA4qECWcya)

camat0 brought an interesting take on Combrei Midrange. Choosing to eschew traditional tools such as Scorpion Wasp and Temple Scribe, camat0 choose to max out on the power fetchers, adding 4 Seek Power, 4 Amber Acolyte, and having 2 Privileges of Rank trying to do the best Secret Pages impression it can. As far as Stonescar Burn hate, they maindecked 2 Protect, which can often be useful against the face burn as well as protecting a threat. In the sideboard was the last 2 copies of protect as well as 3 copies of Lumen Defender. These combine to fight decently well against the gameplan of Stonescar Burn, but still suffers from the lack of a proactive gameplan to end the game before Burn can dome you from 12 or whatever. Rounding out the sideboard is the now seemingly standard 4 pieces of attachment hate in Decay, as well as tools against Rakano in Scorpion Wasp as well as Predatory Carnosaur. While Scorpion Wasp might be able to pull double duty as removal against Stonescar Burn, perhaps more is needed to turn this matchup around. 

## [zevz2990](https://www.eternaldecks.cards/deck/5J7qxaNTEIqEwokasYEsUs)

zevz2990 brought a starkly different, yet similar take to Combrei Midrange to the table. Here we can see the familiar Temple Scribes main, as well as what I expect to be standard from now on Protects. zevz2990 chose to play Stand Together main board which can aid in hastening his clock against Stonescar. Additionally, as a piece of spicy tech, there is 2 Steward of Prophecy in the main deck, almost assuredly there for the Shimmerpack matchup. Outside of the 2 Protects in the mainboard, the list is surprisingly light on Stonescar Burn, perhaps wrongly hoping that it wouldn't show in for the weekend. Instead, there are additional Stand Togethers, Xenan Obelisk, Reality Warden, Great Parliament, and a Sword of the Sky King as well as the obligatorily attachment hate and Scorpion Wasps.

# Rakano Warcry

While Rakano Warcry didn't manage to put any copies in the top 8, it still had a respectable showing at the top tables with 2 4-2 players. Only LocoPojo was matched against Stonescar Burn, and he went a respectable 2-1 facing our fiery overlords. 

## [LocoPojo](http://www.eternaldecks.cards/deck/16Lp2yju80ucmeCy0WO8cW)

LocoPojo brought a "Pantsless Rakano" list championed by finalist jaypeg on ladder in the weeks prior to the tournament. The deck, unlike the traditional Rakano Pants lists, eschews most weapons that are often dead draws for more units and removal. This deck has been highly effective and brought LocoPojo to a stellar finish. There's an excellent writeup on the philosophy of the deck by NeonBlonde [here](https://rngeternal.com/2016/11/28/going-deep-new-age-masters/). In the sideboard, LocoPojo chose be in the anti-big things camp, with 4 Vanquish and 2 more Obliterate. He has 3 Protect that pulls double duty in both the Feln and Stonescar matchups and has some weapons that match up well against the field, with Auric Runehammer being excellent against Stonescar Burn and Stonescar Maul perhaps being the funniest card to use against Shimmerpack ever. 

## [MillerTool](http://www.eternaldecks.cards/deck/5E2pSeJZQWSOUoGcocuqAyh)

On the other hand, MillerTool chose to bring a "Rakano Plate" variant, abusing the interaction between Silverwing Familiar and weapons to out race any and every opponent. This version shaves on the 1 drops, but has Inspire as a turn 1 play. MillerTool came prepeared for Stonescar Burn with a 4 (!) Protect in the main board to complement their aegis lifesteal monster in Silverwing Familiar. Auric Runehammer as well has a tremendous amount of utility against Stonescar Burn, cleanly killing Umbrean Reaper. In the sideboard, MillerTool chose to stock up on the attachment hate, bringing the full 4 Ruin and 4 Furnace Mage, making me wonder what Shimmerpack did to them in a past life. Unfortunately (or fortunately?) for MillerTool, he managed to dodge the Stonescar Burn matchup all tournament. 

# Wrap up

I was going to go in depth for the remaining 5 decks as well, but this is already long and I can feel the quality of this article going to shit. Apologies to Ilyak1986, Rourke, Crispah, and rewind. So overall, Stonescar Burn was as much of a monster as we expected going in. I don't have time this week to crunch individual MU %s for the deck, but perhaps starting next week I can add that to the docket for this series (probably not unless I figure out a way to automate everything. Though I did just discover the challonge log).
