Hello and welcome to the S2W3 edition of the ETS Metagame snapshot. Unfortunately, due to technical issues, last weeks edition was cancelled. Congratulations though to Sir Rhino for his victory with Feln Control! Let's take a quick glance at the week 2 metagame so we have an anchoring point for week 3. 

#### Week 2 Meta

| Deck               | #    | %      |
| ------------------ | ---- | ------ |
| Other              | 13   | 28.89% |
| Stonescar Burn     | 8    | 17.78% |
| Rakano Warcry      | 6    | 13.33% |
| Shimmerpack        | 5    | 11.11% |
| Felnscar           | 3    | 6.67%  |
| Elysian Midrange   | 2    | 4.44%  |
| Feln Control       | 2    | 4.44%  |
| Argenport Midrange | 2    | 4.44%  |
| Stonescar Midrange | 2    | 4.44%  |
| Feln Midrange      | 2    | 4.44%  |

Week 2 continued and in fact increased the dominance of Stonescar Burn in the meta. Rakano Warcry and Shimmerpack followed close behind. Now lets take a look at what changed in week 3

#### Week 3 Meta

| Deck           | #    | %      |
| -------------- | ---- | ------ |
| Other          | 14   | 33.33% |
| Rakano Warcry  | 8    | 19.05% |
| Combrei Aggro  | 8    | 19.05% |
| Feln Control   | 4    | 9.52%  |
| Shimmerpack    | 4    | 9.52%  |
| Xenan Killers  | 2    | 4.76%  |
| Stonescar Burn | 2    | 4.76%  |

With 42 players this week, we have a major upset in terms of deck choice. Stonescar burn's metagame share fell from almost 18% to under 5%, with Rakano Warcry and Combrei Aggro rising to the top with 19% share each. In fact, not only did Burn's metagame share go down, it's win rate was an abysmal 1-8, talk about a fall from glory. While Rakano's presence has been steadily increasing with each week, Combrei Aggro might just be the breakout deck of the weekend. At about 10% each is both Feln Control and the combined Shimmerpack variants, TPJ and Elysian. Let's take a look at the top decks in the swiss.

| ------------ | ------------------- | ----- |
| Unearthly    | Rakano Warcry       | 1     |

Congratulations to Unearthly on his <wbr>in! Additional congrats to Ilyak1985 who finished 2nd after finishing in 3-4 last week and 5-8 the week before. Is next time finally his time to win? There was... a lot of Combrei at 4-2 or better, with 4 of 8 copies of Combrei aggro making it with an additional Vodakhan Combrei midrange hanging out. Shimmerpack had the best conversion ratio, with both the Elysian variants making it in along with one of the TPJ lists. Lets take a look at some of the interesting top 8 lists. 

# Rakano Warcry

The Rakano decks played by both Unearthly and Reiga are the "Righteous Inspiration" variant, hallmarked by Righteous Fury and Inspire along side traditional "Rakano Plate" cards. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pg6D4xP37So&feature=youtu.be) by ETS organizer aReNGee can better explain the deck than I can fit in here, so I highly suggest you watch it. Instead, I'm just going to quickly go over the tech and sideboard choices chosen by each player

## [Unearthly](http://www.eternaldecks.cards/deck/7iPsUwuhlCw804SKcmaMiq)

The primary designer of the deck, Unearthly's main deck is now pretty much the gold standard of Rakano on ladder. In the sideboard, he has the requisite attachment hate in 3 Ruins, as well as additional copies of Vanquish, Righteous Fury, Deepforged Plate, and Soulfire Drake. These are all useful for various matchups, with Vanquish shining against Combrei and Burn, Righteous Fury against Burn, Deepforged Plate against Shimmerpack, and Soulfire Drake against any Shimmerpack as well. There are 4 Protects, good for any control matchup while providing utility against Stonescar Burn. Finally, there are 3 Silverwing Familiar. While there are no more Gilded Glaives running around suping up these things, with Hammer of Might and Deepforged Plate, they can swing any race in an aggressive matchup.

## [Reiga](www.eternaldecks.cards/deck/3T4PF6PeKQKuA2MKSAIaOq)

Reiga brought a (very) slightly different version of the deck, with a Deepforged Plate being exchanged for an Auric Runehammer and an additional Righteous Fury over a power. Runehammer and the third Righteous Fury really help to put the hurt on Stonescar Burn, with Umbrean Reaper in particular running in fear whenever the hammer comes out. In the sideboard, Reiga came with a different, yet similar plan, with even more relic hate with 2 Furnace Mages along side 3 Ruins. He has 4 Feathers to go with a Deepforged Plate as his anti-Shimmepack suite as they do not interact with fliers or overwhelm well. Finally, there are 4 Protects and the fourth Vanquish. 

# Combrei Aggro

A deck that for the first few weeks was absent from the ladder, possibly due to players being constrained on legendaries, Combrei Aggro exploded in popularity this week. Unlike Combrei Midrange which seeks to stall the board until it's late game haymakers can take over, Combrei Aggro leverages the *attacking* ability of cards like Knight-Chancellor Siraf, Valkyrie Enforcer, and Sandstorm Titan alongside Awakened Student, District Infantry, Copperhall Elite, and Crownwatch Paladin to quickly put the hurt on your opponnent. While slightly slower out the gate than Rakano, it can quickly present many massive threats. Most Combrei Aggro decks augment their large units with some combination  Stand Together, Vodakhan's Staff, and Xenan Obelisk, which can all quickly make a few units into massive and hard to remove threats. The decks that Ilyak1986 and Captaind2020 made top 8 with were very similar with some small difference here and there. 

## [Ilyak1986](http://www.eternaldecks.cards/deck/3c3G1NXF5e0UGEsuOuCEag)

Ilyak1986's version of Combrei Aggro definitely skews towards the beatdown. He runs a full 8 copies of unit buffs main, with his primary tool of choice being Vodakhan's Staff. Vodahkan's staff allows for borderline degenerate draws like Crownwatch Paladin or Awakened Student attacking for 5 (or 6!) on turn 3. It also keeps coming back again and again to be a massive thorn in any opponent side that can't silence it. In the sideboard, Ilyak1986 has 3 Finest Hour as a trick that's very relevant in any aggro mirror, 2 Protect for control, additional Obelisks for any sort of Combrei Mirror, 3 Decays as the requisite attachment hate by now, and the super secret tech, 3 Tinker Overseer and 2 Great Parliament to fight against Shimmerpack. One of Combrei Aggro's traditionally horrible matchups due to how much they can stall the ground, these cards allow you to fly over the morass and clock them as long as Scorpion Wasp or Sandstorm Titan don't show up. 

## [Capatind2020](http://www.eternaldecks.cards/deck/2dmIkR7bCwMYoOIkGcWiuI)

Captaind2020 went for a slightly different angle in the main deck than Ilyak1986. Instead of Staves, he has 3 Obelisk to do the heavy lifting of buffing the team. Additionally, there are 3 Auric Sentries instead of Copperhall Elite. While Copperhall Elite provides hard to remove beatdown, Auric Sentry is very good against Rakano of all variants, being able to give warcries while being a brick wall on defense. Captaind2020 also has 3 Inspires which really greases the grooves and helps you hit power drops while buffing whatever you draw into. Their sideboard is largely more of the same of as the maindeck, perhaps having chosen to hedge with the numbers in the main. Unique choices are 2 Teleport, which is tremendous against Rakano, 2 Scorpion Wasp which is great against all unit decks, and 2 Predatory Carnosaur, which is again great against all unit decks. 

# Xenan Killers

One of the few (only?) decks that don't leverage the power of the multi-faction cards in Eternal, Xenan Killers is one of the most powerful decks by innovative deck builder Peppr (RIP IcariaGoliathCrownRoaches). The inner workings of the deck is much better explained by him in the reveal article [here](http://www.numotgaming.com/pepprs-spicy-deck-techs-xenan-serial-killers/). Thought to be largely dead on arrival in open beta due to a nerf to Dawnwalker (Enters exhausted from the void), it has shown that it does not rely on Dawnwalker killer cheese to kill opponents. 

## [Smoonay](http://www.eternaldecks.cards/deck/3lHzt78P4sqOIkqKWyiGaU)

Smoonay brought a slightly tweaked variant of Peppr's original list. Instead of the high variance Initiate of the Sands, they brought 2 more removal spells in annihilate and an additional Vara's Favor to help hit power drops. In the sideboard, there's all the requisite hate, in Decay for attachments, Steward of the Past for Void, and Infitite Hourglass for Permafrost which your author fell victim to.  

# Elysian Shimmerpack

One of the big winners in the transitions from closed to open beta, Elysian Shimmerpack has been a ladder staple. Boasting good to excellent matchups against most of the current top decks, Shimmerpack is one of *the* primary pressures on the meta, as decks need to be able to race it, not in a true life total race, but to kill the Shimmerpack player before their dorks get too big and start jamming in. One of the big post open beta innovations, perhaps due to the Shimmerpack change or just because players realized that it was absurd not to play him, Sandstorm Titan helps hold down the fort and can even kill control decks real quick. There are many core cards, but there are still a decent number of flex slots for innovation.

## [webbwalker](http://www.eternaldecks.cards/deck/6HH4tnvq2AQ4UomwyosssQ)

webbwalker brought perhaps one of the more streamlined builds of Shimmerpack around. With all 3 or 4 ofs outside of a Predatory Carnosaur, he has more payoffs with 4 Xenan Obelisk and 3 Shimmerpack. They opted to skip the Marisen's Disciple, instead choosing 4 Praxis Displacer, a powerful tool against Rakano Warcry and useful to buy time against other aggro decks. The sideboard features 5 pieces of Burn hate with 2 Eilyn's Favor and 3 Lumen Defenders. There are more Polymorphs and 2 Decays for problematic units and attachments. A whole 4 Vault of the Praxis shows that webbwalker was not willing to be beaten by Lightning Storm or Harsh Rule decks. Finally, there are 2 Crystallize which serve as an incredible mirror breaker, where the board can often be bogged down as long as one side doesn't have an Obelisk advantage. 

## [ChiLongQua](http://www.eternaldecks.cards/deck/1EFbzvpzduIUEoeKw8Qm4c)

ChiLongQua, the best fucking Dota player this world has ever seen, brought a similarly streamlined build. Unlike webbwalker, ChiLongQua decided that Marisen's Disciple was the word and opted to play 4 copies of the toolbox army in a can. Additionally, there was a singleton Backlash which is very useful against many different matchups. To fit these cards, they've shaved on Shimmerpack, Predatory Carnosaur, Praxis Displacer, and made perhaps the most controversial choice in 2 Sandstorm Titan. The sideboard has another Carnsoaur and 2 more Backlash. There's also an additional power in Amber Monument for any grindy matchups that come up. Lightning strike is an excellent spell against relic weapons, though the deck is already well positioned there. The real spice is in the 4 copies of Slow. Thought by some to be a Very Bad Card, Slow actually has some very powerful applications. Many of the haymakers good against Shimmerpack cost 4 or 5, with the primary one being Harsh Rule. If you can slow a Harsh Rule to 10, the game will very likely be over by the time it can come back down, making Slow basically a hard discard spell. 

# Stonescar Midrange

One of the mainstays of Eternal now, Stonescar Midrange leverages the power of plentiful 1 for 1 removal to grind your opponent down and eventually present a massive threat in a Cudgeled up *anything*. The deck's success has been cyclical, with a bad W1 showing, an ok W2 showing, and now the only pilot T8ing in W3. 

## [shedd](http://www.eternaldecks.cards/deck/3qp5abYYq4oWkGmCC44AOS)

shedd's main deck is very close to what one would call a "stock" Stonescar Midrange list, loading up on individually powerful cards in Argenport Instigator, Champion of Chaos, Statuary Maiden, Steward of the Past, Umbrean Reaper, and Infernal Tyrant. Infernal Tyrant in particular, while it looks like it would just nuke your board, only kills Umbrean Reaper, which you want to die half the time, and Cabal Countess. In the sideboard, shedd has some real spice, with Charchain Flail to kill any stray aegis threats, Sabotage as additional attachment hate in addition to stripping any Primal card draw that Stonescar Burn can be weak to. Soulfire drake used to be a maindeck staple, but due to curve considerations is relegated to the board here. By now, I think we all know what Azindel's Gift, Plague, Furnace Mage, and Obliterate can do. Finally, there's a Lethrai Falchion which provides some more lifesteal against Stonescar Burn. 

# Wrap Up

There's our top 8. Congrats to everyone who made it, and to everyone else, come back on the 31st with your spiciest deck. While we didn't have a single "dominant" deck, the two top decks had more metagame share than the previous top deck did! Now that I've gone over the majority of major archetypes, in future articles I'm going to be selecting particularly innovative top lists in addition to a metagame breakdown that I want to promise will have in-depth matchup breakdowns, but life can get in the way. While there was a patch on the 19th, there were no balance changes outside of the addition of Wump, Party Starter, so I expect all of you to come with your best angle of attack against the expected meta.
